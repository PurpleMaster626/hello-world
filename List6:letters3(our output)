0
1
2 #this happens because we set the value to zero

0 a
1 b
2 c

#this is an example of unpacking the list
#if we change the [0, "a"] to (0, "a"),it would still be the same

    print(index, letter) 

#our output:
0 a
1 b
2 c
#we can see that altering the program slightly means the same thing.
#we don't need the 2nd and 3rd lines,so we can delete them.

####RECAP:
we can use for loops to find the combination that you need.
