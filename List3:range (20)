numbers = list(range(20))
print(numbers)

#this code finds numbers 1-19

numbers = list(range(20))
print(numbers[::2])

#now,you probably noticed how similar these two programs are.
#am I right?
#while the first code finds all the numbers,the second one only finds even numbers.

numbers = list(range(20))
print(numbers[::-1])

#again we see a similar code that uses the number 20.
#this program finds every number in the oposite order. Example: (19-1).
