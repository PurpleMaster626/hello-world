#This weeks video was about using python to make a list of numbers,letters,or both
#What I tried to do was make a bunch of codes that shoowed everything that I learned
#I hope that you liked these codes,and I will be coding again next week!!!


#Heres a code to copy and figure out:

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
letters[0] = "A"
print(letters)



#Solution:
["A", "b", "c", "d"]
